## Code Execution:
- Ensure the datasets are in the same directory as the source code.
- Once all files are downloaded in the local system, on terminal:

Compilation:
bash
# Compile ELS algorithm
g++ els.cpp -o els.exe

# Compile Tomita algorithm
g++ tomita.cpp -o tomita.exe

# Compile Chiba-Nishizeki algorithm 
g++ chiba.cpp -o chiba.exe

To run:
bash

#  Run the executable
# run ELS algorithm
./els.exe
# run Tomita algorithm
./tomita.exe
# run Chiba-Nishizeki algorithm 
./chiba.exe


### This assignment has analyzed and compared three prominent algorithms for maximal clique enumeration: Bron窶適erbosch with pivot, Bron窶適erbosch with degeneracy ordering, and the arboricity-based method. Our findings reveal that each algorithm has its strengths for different graph types:

- Bron窶適erbosch with pivot serves as a reliable baseline for small to medium-sized graphs.
- Degeneracy ordering excels on large sparse graphs, particularly social and web networks, offering near-optimal performance.
- The arboricity-based method is most efficient for massive sparse and planar graphs, such as road networks.

All three algorithms produced consistent results, validating their correctness. The arboricity-based method demonstrated superior memory efficiency, using 40% less than the Bron窶適erbosch variants.
